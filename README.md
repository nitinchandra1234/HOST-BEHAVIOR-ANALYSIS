Data cleaning. The first step is to clean the data. This means removing any errors, duplicates, or incomplete data. It also means formatting the data so that it is easy to work with.
Exploratory data analysis. The next step is to explore the data. This means looking at the data to see what it tells you. You can use charts, graphs, and other visuals to help you explore the data.
Data preparation. The third step is to prepare the data for analysis. This means transforming the data so that it is ready for analysis. For example, you may need to convert categorical data to numerical data.
Evaluation. The final step is to evaluate the model. This means testing the model to see how well it performs. You can use a variety of metrics to evaluate the model, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Once you have completed these four steps, you will have a better understanding of your data and you will be able to derive useful insights from it.
